            <p><strong>Persona Non Grata</strong> (Latin for "an unwelcome person") is a status applied by a host
                country to a foreign diplomat or other foreign national, signifying that the person is no longer
                acceptable and must leave the country. Under Article 9 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic
                Relations, a host state may at any time, and without having to explain its decision, declare any member
                of a diplomatic mission persona non grata. The sending state must then recall the person or terminate
                their functions with the mission.</p>
            <p>This declaration is the strongest form of disapproval a host country can express towards an individual
                diplomat, short of severing diplomatic ties.</p>
